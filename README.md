# Advanced Learning Algorithms - Labs by DeepLearning.AI

This repository contains labs from the **Advanced Learning Algorithms** course offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). The labs are designed to deepen the understanding of advanced concepts in machine learning and neural networks. All necessary instructions are included in the notebook files.

## Labs Overview

The labs cover the following topics:

1. **Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary)**: Understanding and implementing neural networks to classify handwritten digits into binary classes.
2. **Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Multiclass)**: Extending neural networks to classify handwritten digits into multiple classes.
3. **Applying Machine Learning**: Practical applications of machine learning techniques.
4. **Decision Trees**: Learning about decision tree algorithms and their applications.

## Environment Setup

The environment required to run the notebooks can be created using the provided `environment.yml` file.

### Steps to Download and Use the Environment File

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone *repository https*
   cd your/repository/name
   
3. **Install conda**:
